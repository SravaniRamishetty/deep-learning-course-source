    "\n",
    "There are different types of learning in machine-learning, depending on how a desired relationship is acquired.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supervised\n",
    "\n",
    "$y_d = f(x)$ with $y_d$ as desired output and $x$ as input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Samples in the dataset are {{x1,y1}, {x2, y2}, {x3, y3}} -- both $x$ and $y$ are provided as examples!\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "- a picture of a cat and a category number (1 = cat)\n",
    "\n",

    "<!-- ![](images/cifar10.png) -->\n",
    "\n",
    "- from a list of homework grades (a vector $x$) to final class grade $y$\n",
    "- generating an image from a text caption (Dall-E)\n",

    "## Unsupervised\n",
    "\n",
    "There is only $x$ here! Can we split $x$ in groups?\n",

    "Examples:\n",
    "- a zoo of animals, all of different kinds - group by kind\n",
    "- a set of points, group by closeness (k-means clustering)\n",

    "\n",
    "- a set of people, group by age, race, sex, ...\n",

    "## Self-supervised\n",
    "\n",
    "There is only $x$ here! What is the desired output $y_d$? It is $x$ itself!\n",

    "Examples: \n",
    "- A portion of an image from the rest of the image (in-painting)\n",

    "## Reinforcement learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning to improve a task based on a performance metric. Self-improvement by comparing your results and trying to optimize gains. \n",

    "Examples:\n",
    "- a program that learns to play chess, go, tic-tac-toe, etc. from playing the game\n",
    "- an athlete that wants to improve its moves to achieve better results\n",
    "- a robot that learns to pick-and-place objects by trying not to drop them, or improving speed\n",

    "## Imitation learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Copy a sequence of items from one instance to another. Learning to do something by observing someone else.\n",

    "- learning to draw a figure by observing someone\n",
    "- learning to play music from a youtube video\n",
    "- learning a recipe from a video\n",
    "- learning to code machine-learning from video-lectures\n",
